BOX-SIZING CHANGE (box-sizing property)
The following CSS changes the default box-sizing of box elements from
content-box to border-box.
border-box automatically includes border *and* padding sizes into your
box property widths. No more subtracting padding and border sizes from
your box widths! Now you can use responsive grids without fear of 
making your columns too wide and causing that annoying left-right
scroll bar at the bottom of the page.
Note: this does not take margins into account since margins are 
not technically part of the box. For those, you will still have to 
do some subtraction.

/*
USE IMAGES, EMBEDS AND OBJECTS FREELY WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT SIZES AND
BREAKING YOUR LAYOUTS (max-width property)
The following ensures that images and embedded content you add can't be 
wider than the box element they are currently in. This is important for 
responsive design, as this allows you to use images without having to 
specify width and height attributes in the HTML.
*/

    max-width: 100%;

/*
DEFAULT BEHAVIOR OF SELECTED HYPERLINKS (outline property)
No more ugly dotted outlines on your active links! This is not very 
noticeable until it's pointed out, but it makes for a cleaner user
experience.

    outline: none;
